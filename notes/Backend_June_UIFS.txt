- The business logic is defined for application and kept in application tier.
- The users use application from presentation tier.
- All web applications are 3-tier applications. 


4. Layers
- Application is designed in layers.
- Web applications use a 3 layer architecture
	a) Database layer
		- Creating database
		- Inserting, updating, reading and deleting data. 
	
	b) Business Layer
		- Writing logic to handle communication between client & database.
		- Handling request from client
		- Communicating with database
		- Sending response to client
		- Creating API

	c) Presentation Layer

Roles & Responsibility:
- Creating database
- Storing data into database
- Querying data
- Manipulating data
- Automating the tasks

Purpose of Database Layer:
- Multitier applications maintain their data in database tier.
- A database layer is required to manage data on database tier.

What is Database?
- Database is an entity where you can store relational data.
- It provides simplified techniques for managing data dynamically.


What are the various types of databases?

- RDBMS                MySQL
- Document Based        MongoDB
- NoSQL Database        MongoDB
- SQL Database        MySQL
- Cloud Database         Firebase, Amazon RDS
- Distributed Database    Cassandra, Couchbase
- Data Warehouse        Snowflake, Redshift
  etc..

What are the database models?
1. Conceptual Model
    - It specifies the modules that require data.
    - Developer designs a model that comprises of information about modules
      in your application that require data.

2. Physical Model
    - It comprises of table name, fields, and their data types.
    - Every module is represented with a table.
    - Every table comprises of fields and their data types according business      
      requirements.

3. Logical Model
    - It configures the relationship between modules.
    - Developer need to identify the fields that have relation with other modules.
    - A relationship is configured using Primary & Foreign key.
    - Logical model comprises of table name, field name and relation.

4. Entity Model
    - It configures complete business model for application data.
    - It comprises of table, field, data type and relationship.
    - Developers working in database layer have to design database for application
      by following ER Diagram [ Entity Relation Diagram]

Setup MongoDB on your device:

1. Download and Install MongoDB community server
    https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community

2. Select "MongoDB Compass" while installing database
    - It is a GUI tool used to manage database.

3. Start MongoDB server   
    - programs -> services -> right click on MongoDB server -> start
    - MongoDB server address is
       
            mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017
                     (or)
            mongodb://localhost:27017

4. Open "MongoDB Compass" which is a client tool required for communicating with MongoDB server.
        Server            : It is the location where data is kept.
        Client            : It is the location from where we manipulate the data.


5. Click on "New Connection"

6. Define connection string
        mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017

7. Save and connect


8. You will find the default databases on server

        a) admin    
        b) local
        c) config

                        MongoDB Terminology

1. Database            It is a store where data is kept.
                    Every application stores its data in a database.

2. Collection            It is the location where data for any specific module is stored.
                    A single database can have multiple collections.
                    Collection is structure less.
                    [ It is similar to a table in structured database ]

3. Document            In a collection every individual record is a document.
                    Every document represents an object.
                    Each document comprises of BSON data.

4. Field                It refers to the key that stores a value.
                    Keys are always string type.

5. Embedded            It refers to a join.

                        MongoDB Shell  [mongosh]

- It provides CLI [command line interface].
- CLI is used to query and manipulate data through commands.
- Select the connection name to open mongosh in MongoDB compass.
- It opens a mongo terminal where you can execute the commands.

1. To view the list of databases
        > show dbs
2. To view the current active database
        > db
3. To clear the current screen
        > cls
4. To create a new database
        > use  database_name

      It uses a logic, if database name exists then it will switch into the database.
                         if database doesn't exist, then it creates a new database.


    Note: Database is not displayed in the list if it doesn't contain any collection.

                        Creating Collection

- MongoDB collection is an array of objects.
- Collection is structure less or semi structured.
- MongoDB provides the method "createCollection()" to create a new collection.
- Current database related any command you have to invoke by using "db".

            > db.createCollection()

Syntax:
             > db.createCollection(collectionName, { options });

- Options are not mandatory you can skip options, however it takes the default values for options.

- You can configure following options for a collection:

    Option                Description
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    autoIndexId [boolean]     It is a Boolean property that sets an unique ID for every
                        document.
                        It generates a unique ID automatically for every document
                        when set to true.
                        Its default value is true.
   
    max            [number]    It specifies the maximum number of records that a                                 collection can handle. You can limit the documents.


    capped        [boolean]    It depends on the "max" property.

                        If capped is set to true then it replaces the old document
                        with new document when it reaches the max limit.

                        If capped is false then it will not allow to add new docs
                        after max limit.

                        The default is false.
   
    size            [number]    It defines the memory allocated for collection.
                        You can't store documents when allocated memory is full.
               
                        It varies according to device if not defined.
                   
                        It is defined in bytes.

Syntax:
  > db.createCollection("name", { autoIndexId: true/false,  max:number, size:number, capped:true/false })
           

                8 bits         =     1 byte
                1024 bytes    =    1 kb
                1024 kb        =     1 mb
                1024 mb        =     1 gb
                1024 gb        =     1 tb

Ex:
  > db.createCollection("categories", { autoIndexId: true, max:10, size:4194304, capped:true})
 
  > db.createCollection("products")

- To view the collections of current database

  > show collections

- To remove any specific collection you have to use "drop()" method

  > db.collectionName.drop()
  > db.customers.drop()

- To remove any specific database, first switch into the database run the command
   "dropDatabase()".

   > db.dropDatabase()

   
                        Adding Documents

- Every document represents an object.
- Object is used to keep relative data together.
- Object is a key and value collection.
- Object keys are string type and value can be any type.

        {
           "key" : value,  
           "key" : value
        }

- MongoDB value types can be Binary Stream type, which is often known as BSON.
- BSON is similar to JSON types.
- It supports all JavaScript types
    a) Primitive
    b) Non Primitive

- To insert any document MongoDB provides the methods

    a) insertOne()
    b) insertMany()

Syntax:
    >db.collection.insertOne( {  } )
    >db.collection.insertMany( [ { }, { },.. ] )

Ex:
      >db.products.insertOne( { id:1, name:"tv", cities:['delhi', 'hyd'], rating:{rate:4.2} })
    >db.products.insertMany( [ { }, { } ] )

- Creating Database
- Creating Collection
- Insert Documents into Collection

                          Query Documents
- MongoDB uses "find()" method to query documents from a collection.
- Find can access and return one or multiple documents.

Syntax:
     > db.collection.find( { query } )
     > db.products.find({ })                // returns all documents

- You can configure query using various operators to filter and view the matching documents.

         $eq            Equal to
         $ne            Not Equal
         $gt            Greater than
         $gte        Greater than or equal
         $lt            Less than
         $lte            Less than or equal
         $and        Logical AND
         $or            Local OR

Syntax:
     > db.collection.find( { key: value } )        => return exact match

Ex:
     > db.fakestore.find( {id : 3} )
     > db.fakestore.find( {category: 'electronics' } )

Syntax: Query using condition

      > db.collection.find( { field: {condition} } )
     
Ex:
      > db.fakestore.find({ price:{$gte:600} })

- You can query the documents with object type reference by enclosing in single quote.

Syntax:
     > db.collection.find( { 'field.key' : { condition } } )

Ex:
     > db.fakestore.find({ 'rating.rate': {$gte:4.5} })


- You can add multiple expressions using "$and"  & "$or" operators.
- "$and" returns the data only when all expressions evaluate to true.
- "$or"  returns the data when any one expression evaluates to true.
- Multiple expressions are enclosed in "[ ]".

Syntax:
      >db.collection.find({ $and: [ {exp1}, {exp2}, .. ] })

Query: How to read all documents whose price is between 300 to 600.
        - fakestore        : collection
        - price            : field name

 >db.fakestore.find({ $and: [ {price:{$gte:300}}, {price:{$lte:600}} ] })

Query : Read all electronics with price above 500

            category = electronics
            price >= 500

>db.fakestore.find({ $and: [ {category:"electronics"}, {price:{$gte:500}} ] })

Query: Read all electronics & jewelery products from fakestore collection


 > db.collection.find({ $or: [ { }, { } ] })

Ex:	
    >db.fakestore.find({$or: [ {category:"electronics"}, {category:"jewelery" } ]})


Query: Read all electronics whose rating is above 4.6
       
        category: electronics
        'rating.rate': 4.6

    > db.fakestore.find({ $and: [ {category:"electronics"}, {'rating.rate': {&gt:4.6}} ] })

Query: Read all jewelery products and other products whose rating is above 4.5

   
    > db.fakestore.find({ $or:[ {category:"jewelery"}, {'rating.rate':{$gt:4.5}} ] })

Query: Read all jewelery & electronics between price 100 to 500.

    >db.products.find({$and:[{$or:[{"category":"jewelery"},{"category":"electronics"}]},{"price":{$gte: 100,$lte: 500 } }] })
    >db.products.find({$and:[{$or:[{"category":"jewelery"},{"category":"electronics"}]},{"price":{$gte:100}},{"price":{$lte:500}}]})

=====

db.collection.find({
$and: [
{ price: { $gt: 500 } },
{
$or: [
{ category: "electronics" },
{ category: "jewellery" }
]
}
]
})

Querying Data from Collection
- find()
- Operators
   
                        Querying Array Type

- Array type is defined in a collection using array meta character "[ ]".

Syntax:
        {
           shippedTo: [ 'Delhi', 'Hyd' ]
        }

- To search or query any content from array type MongoDB provides "$all" operator.
- It can verify all elements and return only the matching documents from collection.

Syntax:

    >db.collection.find({ fieldname: { $all: ['element'] } })

Ex:
   > db.products.find({ shippedTo: { $all: [ 'Hyd' ] } })

Ex:
 collection : products

{
  "name": "Mobile",
  "price": 15000,
  "shippedTo": [
    "Delhi",
    "Mumbai"
  ]
},
{
  "name": "TV",
  "price": 25000,
  "shippedTo": [
    "Hyd",
    "Mumbai"
  ]
}

                        Querying Date Type

- MongoDB uses "$date" operator to configure a date type value.
- Date must be in the format of ISO.
   
        "year-month-dateThours:minutes:seconds.milliSecondsZ"

- Date is an object with ISO format and defined using  "$date" operator

Syntax:
       
    {
      "mfd" : {
        "$date" : "yy-mm-ddThrs:min:sec.millSecZ"
        }
    }

- To query date value MongoDB provides "ISODate()" function.
- It is configured along with find() function.

Syntax:
   
     >db.collection.find({ field: ISODate("yy-mm-ddThrs:min:sec.milliSec") })

Ex:
      >db.products.find({ mfd: ISODate("2025-04-22T14:20:41.000Z") })


Ex:
{
    "name": "TV",
  "price": 30000,
  "mfd": {
    "$date": "2025-03-22T14:20:41.000Z"
  }
},

{
  "name": "Mobile",
  "price": 12000,
  "mfd": {
    "$date": "2025-04-22T14:20:41.000Z"
  }
}

Note: You can search for any document and return only the first occurrence document that matches given condition.
      It requires "findOne()" method to find and returns the first occurrence.

Syntax:
    > db.fakestore.find({category:"electronics"})            // returns all electronics
    > db.fakestore.findOne({category: "electronics"})        // returns specific

                           Updating Documents
- MongoDB provides the methods
    a) updateOne()
    b) updateMany()
- You have to find the relative document and update its data or fields.
- Update requires following operators

    $set            It sets a new value into specific field
    $unset        It removes specific field
    $rename        It allows to change field name.

Syntax:
    >db.collection.updateOne( { findQuery }, { updateQuery } )

Ex: Change value in specific field

       > db.fakestore.updateOne( {id:1}, { $set: { price: 400.44 } })

Ex: Set rating as 4.6 for all products whose price is above 500

    > db.fakestore.updateMany({price:{$gte:500}}, {$set:{'rating.rate':4.6}})

- You can add new fields into document by using "$set"

    >db.collection.updateOne({findQuery}, {$set: {newField:value}})

Ex:
    >db.products.updateOne({name:"TV"}, {$set: {stock:true}})

- You can change the field name by using "$rename" operator

Syntax
    >db.collection.updateMany({}, {$rename:{ "old" : "new" }})    

Ex:
     >db.products.updateMany({},{$rename:{"mfd":"manufactured"}})

- You can remove any specific field and its data by using "$unset" operator

Syntax:
    > db.collection.updateMany({ }, { $unset: "fieldname" })

    note: Fieldname refers to name and value defined as object.
   
    > db.products.updateMany({}, { $unset: { stock: " " })

                        Deleting Documents
- MongoDB can remove documents by using

    a) deleteOne()
    b) deleteMany()

- It uses find query to find and remove the data.

Syntax:
    >db.collection.deleteOne({ findQuery })

    >db.fakestore.deleteMany({ category: "electronics" })
    >db.fakestore.deleteOne({id:7})
    >db.fakestore.deleteMany({'rating.rate':{$lte:3}})

FAQ: How to drop collection and database?
Ans:
        >db.collection.drop()
        >db.dropDatabase()


                    MongoDB Schema Validation

- Validation is the process of verifying user input.
- Validation is required to ensure that contradictory and unauthorized data is not get stored into database.
- MongoDB allows to configure a schema validation.
- It is a validation defined for collection.
- A collection can restrict the fields, data type and data limits.
- Collection uses several options like
        a) autoIndexId
        b) max
        c) size
        d) capped
- Collection also provides validation options like
        a) validator
        b) validationType / validationLevel
        c) validationAction

- Validator is used to define validation for fields
- validationType defines strict or moderate validation.

        a) strict        : It will not allow to by-pass the validation
        b) moderate    : It allows to by-pass the validation with warning

- validationAction defines the error return type, you can notify as

        a) error        : As Error message    
        b) warn        : As Warning message

Syntax:
  > db.createCollection("name", {  
            validator:{ },
            validationType:"strict",   | validationLevel: "strict"
            validationAction:"error"
        })

- Validator is an object that configures validation schema by using "$jsonSchema"

Syntax:
   > db.createCollection("name", {

             validator: {
                $jsonSchema: { }
             }
        })

- $jsonSchema is an object with following properties

        a) bsonType
        b) required
        c) properties

- Schema "bsonType" is always "object"  type.
- Required is array that defines the fields allowed in collection.
- Properties is an object with collection of fields and their validations.

Syntax:
    > db.createCollection("name", {

          validator: {

            $jsonSchema: {
                   bsonType: "object",
                   required: [ "field1", "field2",..],
                   properties: { }
            }            
          }
     })

- Properties are configured for every field individually.
- Each field comprises of data type, validation service, error message as description.

Syntax:
            properties : {
                field1: {
                bsonType: "data_type",
                required: true,
                minimum: value,
                maximum: value,
                description : "error message"
                },
                field2: { }
                ....
                ....
            }

- The bson types allowed by MongoDB for various data types are shown below

Syntax:
  > db.createCollection("users", {

        validator: {
            $jsonSchema: {
                   bsonType: "object",
                   required: [ "username", "age"  ],
                   properties: {

MongoDB Schema Validation
- Configure Validation for New Collection

Generate Rules for existing collection
1. Create a new collection

        > db.createCollection("products")

2. Insert document into collection

        > db.products.insertOne({id:1, name:"tv", price:4000, qty:2, stock:true})

3. Go to database => select collection name  in MongoDB compass

4. Go to "Validation" category

5. Generate Rules
 
Note: You can edit rules using edit option in Compass.


                       MongoDB Aggregation
- Aggregation is a framework use to filter, sort, group and perform various queries on data.
- MongoDB provides different aggregation stages and operators.

Stage                Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$match                It is used to filter documents [find]

$group                It is used to group document based on specified key.
                    Key refers to a field.

$project                It is used to reshape the query. Such as including or excluding
                    fields.

$sort                It sorts documents. 1 for ascending -1 for descending.

$limit                It limits the number of documents to display in result.

$lookup                 It is used to group and fetch fields from multiple collections.


Operators            Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 $sum                finds the sum of values

 $count                returns the count of values in a group

 $multiply                returns the product

 $avg                finds the average of values

 etc..

Syntax: Aggregation Stage

    > db.collection.aggregate([ { } ])

- Aggregate() is a method that comprises of collection of queries.

Query: Get only id, title and price from products

    > db.products.aggregate([ { $project: { id:1, title:1, price:1 } } ])

Query: Get only electronic products

    > db.products.aggregate([ { $match: {category: "electronics"} } ])

Query: Get all electronics with only title and price

        > db.products.aggregate([ { $match: {category: "electronics"} }, { $project: { title:1, price:1 } } ])

FAQ: Without aggregation how you can access multiple categories?
      [without using logical $and, $or]
Ans:  By using "$in"

    > db.products.find({category:{$in: ["electronics", "jewelery"]}})

Query: Find all products whose category is electronics or jewelery and rating is
        above 4.

    > db.products.find({$and:[{category:{$in:["electronics", "jewelery"]}}, {'rating.rate':{$gte:4}}]})


Query : Sort all the products in descending order of price

    > db.products.aggregate([{$sort:{price:-1}}, {$limit:4}])

       limit:4        => returns top 3 results [ up to 4 ]

Query:  Returns all electronics with price in descending order and display only top 2.

    > db.products.aggregate([{$match:{category:"electronics"}}, {$sort:{price:-1}}, {$limit:3}])

Query : Return all electronics in descending order of their rating.

    > db.products.aggregate([{$match:{category:"electronics"}}, {$sort: {'rating.rate':-1}}])

Query:  Group all products by their category and find the average price of products
         in every category.

  - $group is used to group by any field.
  - The field is referred with unique "_id".
  - Field name in group is defined with "$name".

Syntax:
      >db.collection.aggregate([ {$group:{ _id:"$fieldName", total|avg|count:"$field" }} ])

Ex:
   >db.fakestore.aggregate([ {$group: {_id:"$category", avgPrice:{$avg:"$price"} } } ])
   >db.fakestore.aggregate([ {$group: {_id:"$category", totalPrice:{$sum:"$price"} } } ])

Query: Get the total count of products in every category

   >db.fakestore.aggregate([ {$group: {_id:"$category", count:{ $sum:1} }} ])
